About
-----

Monero is a cryptocurrency that traditionally has only supported transacting using local (or sometimes remote) wallets via their JSON RPC API. However, with Monero's new light wallet API we have the ability to securely create and view transactions using remote servers. This lowers the barrier of entry for new Monero users and allows for new applications to be made. This library implements a client for this new API.
